# hello-world
My first repository

Hi I am cyberabc

I love computer.I have a keen passion to do something new.I love reading any new subject. I am pleased to take challenges.
Now I am learning html, css, javascript, bootstraps, Jquery,And ultimately php. I have faced a lot of problems in understanding OOPs.
"when you learn a subject for the first time it is  hard and tough but after revising 2nd time 3rd...nth time it will be easy!"

Thats my realization!!

thanks for getting me in GitHub. I am wondering what GitHub is all about and i am learning now.
